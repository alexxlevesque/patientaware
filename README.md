# Context-Aware Clinical Support Platform

## Overview
Canada’s healthcare system faces structural constraints that reduce appointment effectiveness and compromise diagnostic quality. Limited physician time, chronic doctor shortages, and fragmented patient information lead to weak continuity of care, inefficient consultations, and elevated risks of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.

This project proposes an AI-driven, context-aware platform designed to restore clinical context to the point of care.

## Problem
- Physician time is severely constrained  
- Systemic doctor shortages across Canada  
- Limited access to longitudinal patient context  
- Weak patient–doctor continuity  
- Inefficient appointments  
- Increased misdiagnosis and late diagnosis risk  

## Solution
- Patients continuously log symptoms, medical history, and life context through a dashboard  
- Context is longitudinally linked to the patient (e.g., via OHIP)  
- AI summarizes logs, symptoms, and prior appointments for physicians  
- Each patient log is stored as a new contextual thread using Backboard.ai, building a persistent background over time  
- Physicians access concise, structured insights before and during appointments  

## Impact
- Significant physician time savings  
- Improved diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making  
- More effective, focused appointments  
- Stronger patient–doctor relationships  
- Better continuity of care despite system constraints  

## Vision
Deliver context-rich, AI-curated insights at the point of care to materially improve healthcare outcomes in resource-constrained systems.
